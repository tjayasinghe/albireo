# Benchmarks & validation record

Running record of correctness and performance results at each milestone. Numbers are
from the referenced tests, which reproduce them deterministically (fixed seeds); no
claim here is asserted without a test.

## M2 — fixed-orbit linear solver (2026-08-11)

Machine: Windows 11 laptop, CPU only, float64, un-jitted (JAX 0.11). Performance work
is deliberately deferred (jit, custom band assembly, GPU batching — M3/M5); M2 is a
correctness milestone.

### Exactness

| Check | Result | Test |
|---|---|---|
| marginal log-likelihood vs. dense brute-force marginalization (mixed instruments, masks, response) | rtol 1e-10 | `test_marginal_matches_dense_brute_force` |
| posterior mean & pointwise variance vs. dense | rtol 1e-7 | same |
| block-tridiagonal Cholesky / logdet / solves / Takahashi selected inverse vs. LAPACK dense | rtol 1e-10 | `test_solver.py` |
| comb-probe assembly reproduces the matrix-free operator | exact (validated per run) | `test_probe_assembly_is_exact`, `validate=True` |
| garbage values at masked pixels change nothing | rtol 1e-12 | `test_masked_pixel_values_do_not_affect_anything` |

### Closed-loop recovery (the M2 acceptance gate)

Simulated SB2: SNR 100, 30 epochs (4 in partial eclipse), K = (45, 70) km/s, e = 0.2,
Gaussian LSF 4 km/s, model grid dv = 2.5 km/s (n = 2114 px), 5% chip gaps + cosmics,
truth solved with true nonlinear parameters (`test_closed_loop_recovery_snr100_30_epochs`):

| Metric | Component 1 | Component 2 | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| line-region RMS error | 0.52% | 0.73% | < 1% ✓ |
| whitened data residual variance | 0.975 (pooled) | | ~1 ✓ |
| posterior-draw std vs. Takahashi std (median ratio) | ~1.0 | | consistency ✓ |

Wall time for one full marginal-likelihood evaluation (assembly + factorization +
solve + logdet) at this scale: **1.6 s** (CPU, un-jitted, probe assembly = 141
operator applications). The design-target scale (2×10⁵ px, 50 epochs) on GPU is the
M5 gate.

### Nullspace / degeneracy analysis (empirical)

The low-frequency separation theory of [math.md §5.1](math.md) is verified
numerically: the posterior variance of the per-mode "difference" direction matches
`1 / (w l² (J − |g(k)|) + prior(k))` with `g(k) = Σ_j e^{ik ΔΔ_j}` within a factor
~1.5 over a decade of spatial frequency, with the predicted ~5× variance inflation
toward low k (`test_low_frequency_degeneracy_matches_theory`, Hann-windowed modes).

Two lessons from the closed loop, both now baked into tests and docs:

1. **The k = 0 additive indeterminacy is real and quantitative.** Each component's
   mean absorption depression differs; with constant light ratios the data see only
   the light-weighted sum, and the invisible difference (the `ℓ₁Δd₁ + ℓ₂Δd₂ = 0`
   direction) is set entirely by the prior — a ~1.5–2% systematic offset between
   components in our configuration, *for any method*. Four eclipse epochs (per-epoch
   light fractions) make it observable and remove it — the documented breaker
   (math.md §5.2) demonstrated end-to-end.
2. **Sub-LSF scales are honestly unrecoverable.** With a weak smoothness prior the
   posterior std is dominated by a flat ~5–7% contribution from deconvolution modes
   below the instrument resolution. The prior curvature scale must encode the true
   spectral smoothness (here set by hand; ML-II optimization of the marginal
   likelihood is the M3 mechanism). This is reported variance, not hidden error —
   the point of the method.
